House Price Prediction Using ML

Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
Feature Scaling:

Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure that they are on a similar scale. This helps prevent certain features from dominating the model training process.
Model Selection:

Choose a suitable regression model for predicting house prices. Common models include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or more advanced models like gradient boosting.
Model Training:

Train the selected model on the training dataset, allowing it to learn the patterns and relationships between the input features and the target variable (house prices).
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance. This may involve adjusting parameters like learning rate, regularization strength, or tree depth, depending on the chosen model.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared.
Prediction:

Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data. This allows the model to estimate house prices based on input features.
Monitoring and Updating:

Regularly monitor the model's performance and update it if necessary. This ensures that the model remains accurate as new data becomes available or if the underlying patterns in the housing market change.
